 nhttp://nips.cc/Conferences/2016/Schedule?showEvent=6197\n\nDeep learning 
 has been at the root of significant progress in many application areas\, s
 uch as computer perception and natural language processing. But almost all
  of these systems currently use supervised learning with human-curated lab
 els. The challenge of the next several years is to let machines learn from
  raw\, unlabeled data\, such as images\, videos and text. Intelligent syst
 ems today do not possess "common sense"\, which humans and animals acquire
  by observing the world\, acting in it\, and understanding the physical co
 nstraints of it. I will argue that allowing machine to learn predictive mo
 dels of the world is key to significant progress in artificial intelligenc
 e\, and a necessary component of model-based planning and reinforcement le
 arning.  The main technical difficulty is that the world is only partially
  predictable. A general formulation of unsupervised learning that deals wi
 th partial predictability will be presented. The formulation connects many
  well-known approaches to unsupervised learning\, as well as new and excit
 ing ones such as adversarial\ntraining.

 432\n\nWe study the cost function for  hierarchical clusterings introduced
  by [Dasgupta\, 2015]  where hierarchies are treated as first-class object
 s rather than deriving their cost from projections into flat clusters. It 
 was also shown in [Dasgupta\, 2015] that a top-down algorithm  returns a h
 ierarchical clustering of cost at most (O\\left(\\alphan \\log n\\right)) 
 times the cost of the optimal hierarchical clustering\, where (\\alphan) i
 s the approximation ratio of the Sparsest Cut subroutine used. Thus using 
 the best known approximation algorithm for Sparsest Cut due to Arora-Rao-V
 azirani\,  the top down algorithm returns a hierarchical clustering of cos
 t at most  (O\\left(\\log^{3/2} n\\right)) times the cost of the optimal s
 olution. We improve this by giving an (O(\\log{n}))-approximation algorith
 m for this problem. Our main technical ingredients are a combinatorial cha
 racterization of ultrametrics induced by this cost function\, deriving an 
 Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation for this family of ultrametri
 cs\, and showing how to iteratively round an LP relaxation of this formula
 tion by  using the idea of \\emph{sphere growing} which has been extensive
 ly used in the context of graph  partitioning. We also prove that our algo
 rithm returns an (O(\\log{n}))-approximate  hierarchical clustering for a 
 generalization of this cost function also studied in [Dasgupta\, 2015]. Ex
 periments show that the hierarchies found by using the ILP formulation as 
 well  as our rounding algorithm often have better projections into flat cl
 usters than the standard linkage based algorithms. We conclude with an ina
 pproximability result for this problem\, namely that no polynomial sized L
 P or SDP can be used to obtain a constant factor approximation for this pr
 oblem.

 6\n\nFunctional brain networks are well described and estimated from data 
 with Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs)\, e.g.\\ using sparse inverse covari
 ance estimators. Comparing functional connectivity of subjects in two popu
 lations calls for comparing these estimated GGMs. Our goal is to identify 
 differences in GGMs known to have similar structure. We characterize the u
 ncertainty of differences with confidence intervals obtained using a param
 etric distribution on parameters of a sparse estimator. Sparse penalties e
 nable statistical guarantees and interpretable models even in high-dimensi
 onal and low-sample settings. Characterizing the distributions of sparse m
 odels is inherently challenging as the penalties produce a biased estimato
 r. Recent work invokes the sparsity assumptions to effectively remove the 
 bias from a sparse estimator such as the lasso.  These distributions can b
 e used to give confidence intervals on edges in GGMs\, and by extension th
 eir differences. However\, in the case of comparing GGMs\, these estimator
 s do not make use of any assumed joint structure among the GGMs. Inspired 
 by priors from brain functional connectivity we derive the distribution of
  parameter differences under a joint penalty when parameters are known to 
 be sparse in the difference. This leads us to introduce the debiased multi
 -task fused lasso\, whose distribution can be characterized in an efficien
 t manner. We then show how the debiased lasso and multi-task fused lasso c
 an be used to obtain confidence intervals on edge differences in GGMs. We 
 validate the techniques proposed on a set of synthetic examples as well as
  neuro-imaging dataset created for the study of autism.

 ade off between computational complexity and query complexity\; We prove t
 hat for the case of $k$-means clustering (i.e.\, when the expert conforms 
 to a solution of $k$-means)\, having access to relatively few such queries
  allows efficient solutions to otherwise NP hard problems.  In particular\
 , we provide a probabilistic polynomial-time (BPP) algorithm  for clusteri

 queries and runs with time complexity $O\\big(kn\\log n)$ (where $k$ is th

 he algorithm is guaranteed for data satisfying the margin condition under 
 which\, without queries\, we show that the problem is NP hard. We also pro
 ve a lower bound on the number of queries needed to have a computationally
  efficient clustering algorithm in this setting.

  Michael Chertkov \, Jinwoo Shin\nhttp://nips.cc/Conferences/2016/Schedule
 ?showEvent=7447\n\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Belief Propagation 
 (BP) are the most popular algorithms for computational inference in Graphi
 cal Models (GM).  In principle\, MCMC is an exact probabilistic method whi
 ch\, however\, often suffers from exponentially slow mixing. In contrast\,
  BP  is a deterministic method\, which is typically fast\,  empirically ve
 ry successful\, however in general lacking control of accuracy over loopy 
 graphs.  In this paper\, we introduce MCMC algorithms correcting the appro
 ximation error of BP\, i.e.\,  we provide a way to compensate for BP error
 s via a consecutive BP-aware MCMC.  Our framework is based on the Loop Cal
 culus (LC) approach  which allows to express the BP error  as a sum of wei
 ghted generalized loops. Although the full series is computationally intra
 ctable\,  it is known that a truncated series\, summing up all 2-regular l
 oops\, is computable in polynomial-time for planar pair-wise binary GMs an
 d it also provides a highly accurate approximation empirically. Motivated 
 by this\, we\, first\, propose a polynomial-time approximation MCMC scheme
  for the truncated series of general (non-planar) pair-wise binary models.
   Our main idea here is to use the Worm algorithm\, known to provide fast 
 mixing in other (related) problems\, and then  design an appropriate rejec
 tion scheme to sample 2-regular loops. Furthermore\, we also design an eff
 icient rejection-free MCMC scheme  for approximating the full series.  The
  main novelty underlying our design  is in utilizing the concept of cycle 
 basis\, which provides an efficient decomposition of the generalized loops
 . In essence\, the proposed MCMC schemes run on transformed GM built upon 
  the non-trivial BP solution\, and our experiments show that this synthesi
 s of BP and MCMC  outperforms both direct MCMC and bare BP schemes.

 t Neural Networks (RNNs) have become the state-of-the-art choice for extra
 cting patterns from temporal sequences. Current RNN models are ill suited 
 to process irregularly sampled data triggered by events generated in conti
 nuous time by sensors or other neurons. Such data can occur\, for example\
 , when the input comes from novel event-driven artificial sensors which ge
 nerate sparse\, asynchronous streams of events or from multiple convention
 al sensors with different update intervals. In this work\, we introduce th
 e Phased LSTM model\, which extends the LSTM unit by adding a new time gat
 e. This gate is controlled by a parametrized oscillation with a frequency 
 range which require updates of the memory cell only during a small percent
 age of the cycle. Even with the sparse updates imposed by the oscillation\
 , the Phased LSTM network achieves faster convergence than regular LSTMs o
 n tasks which require learning of long sequences.   The model naturally in
 tegrates inputs from sensors of arbitrary sampling rates\, thereby opening
  new areas of investigation for processing asynchronous sensory events tha
 t carry timing information.  It also greatly improves the performance of L
 STMs in standard RNN applications\, and does so with an order-of-magnitude

DESCRIPTION:Oral:MetaGrad: Multiple Learning Rates in Online Learning\nTim
  van Erven \, Wouter M Koolen\nhttp://nips.cc/Conferences/2016/Schedule?sh
 owEvent=7450\n\nIn online convex optimization it is well known that certai
 n subclasses of objective functions are much easier than arbitrary convex 
 functions. We are interested in designing adaptive methods that can automa
 tically get fast rates in as many such subclasses as possible\, without an
 y manual tuning. Previous adaptive methods are able to interpolate between
  strongly convex and general convex functions. We present a new method\, M
 etaGrad\, that adapts to a much broader class of functions\, including exp
 -concave and strongly convex functions\, but also various types of stochas
 tic and non-stochastic functions without any curvature. For instance\, Met
 aGrad can achieve logarithmic regret on the unregularized hinge loss\, eve
 n though it has no curvature\, if the data come from a favourable probabil
 ity distribution. MetaGrad's main feature is that it simultaneously consid
 ers multiple learning rates. Unlike all previous methods with provable reg
 ret guarantees\, however\, its learning rates are not monotonically decrea
 sing over time and are not tuned based on a theoretically derived bound on
  the regret. Instead\, they are weighted directly proportional to their em
 pirical performance on the data using a tilted exponential weights master 
 algorithm.

 \nhttp://nips.cc/Conferences/2016/Schedule?showEvent=7439\n\nUntil recentl
 y\, research on artificial neural networks was largely restricted to syste
 ms with only two types of variable: Neural activities that represent the c
 urrent or recent input and weights that learn to capture regularities amon
 g inputs\, outputs and payoffs. There is no good reason for this restricti
 on. Synapses have dynamics at many different time-scales and this suggests
  that artificial neural networks might benefit from variables that change 
 slower than activities but much faster than the standard weights.  These `
 `fast weights'' can be used to store temporary memories of the recent past
  and they provide a neurally plausible way of implementing the type of att
 ention to the past that has recently proven helpful in sequence-to-sequenc
 e models. By using fast weights we can avoid the need to store copies of n
 eural activity patterns.

 \nhttp://nips.cc/Conferences/2016/Schedule?showEvent=7451\n\nWe study the 
 sampling-based planning problem in Markov decision processes (MDPs) that w
 e can access only through a generative model\, usually referred to as Mont
 e-Carlo planning. Our objective is to return a good estimate of the optima
 l value function at any state while minimizing the number of calls to the 
 generative model\, i.e. the sample complexity. We propose a new algorithm\
 , TrailBlazer\, able to handle MDPs with a finite or an infinite number of
  transitions from state-action to next states. TrailBlazer is an adaptive 
 algorithm that exploits possible structures of the MDP by exploring only a
  subset of states reachable by following near-optimal policies. We provide
  bounds on its sample complexity that depend on a measure of the quantity 
 of near-optimal states. The algorithm behavior can be considered as an ext
 ension of Monte-Carlo sampling (for estimating an expectation) to problems
  that alternate maximization (over actions) and expectation (over next sta
 tes). Finally\, another appealing feature of TrailBlazer is that it is sim
 ple to implement and computationally efficient.

 Schedule?showEvent=7452\n\nExpectation Maximization (EM) is among the most
  popular algorithms for estimating parameters of statistical models.  Howe
 ver\, EM\, which is an iterative algorithm based on the maximum likelihood
  principle\, is generally only guaranteed to find stationary points of the
  likelihood objective\, and these points may be far from any maximizer.  T
 his article addresses this disconnect between the statistical principles b
 ehind EM and its algorithmic properties.  Specifically\, it provides a glo
 bal analysis of EM for specific models in which the observations comprise 
 an i.i.d. sample from a mixture of two Gaussians.  This is achieved by (i)
  studying the sequence of parameters from idealized execution of EM in the
  infinite sample limit\, and fully characterizing the limit points of the 
 sequence in terms of the initial parameters\; and then (ii) based on this 
 convergence analysis\, establishing statistical consistency (or lack there
 of) for the actual sequence of parameters produced by EM.

 its open ended nature\, collaboration with other players\, and creativity 
 in game-play.In this demo\, we show the capabilities of the Project Malmo 
 platform and the kind of research they enable. These range from 3D navigat

 easily exchange tasks and recorded data. Recently\, the platform was publi

 nteractive robots\, which respond to a human's linguistic instructions by 
 generating appropriate behavior. This study extended the method by constru
 cting target data not as unimodal language sequences\, but as multimodal s
 equences of words\, vision\, and the robot's joint angles. By using them t
 o train the RNN\, the robot can acquire the ability to deal with interacti

 , that is\, the repetition of instruction\, behavior\, and waiting for sub
 sequent instructions\, can be autonomously learned from the data\, so the 
 execution of the task is achieved by continuous forward propagation alone.
 \nThis proposal has the following novelty: (1) We implemented a long short

 nly used in the field of natural language processing\, for interactive rob

 ochastic block model (SBM) has long been studied in machine learning and n
 etwork science as a canonical model for clustering and community detection
 . In the recent years\, new developments have demonstrated the presence of
  threshold phenomena for this model\, which have set new challenges for al
 gorithms. For the {\\it detection} problem in symmetric SBMs\, Decelle et 
 al.\\ conjectured that the so-called Kesten-Stigum (KS) threshold can be a
 chieved efficiently. This was proved for two communities\, but remained op
 en from three communities. We prove this conjecture here\, obtaining a mor
 e general result that applies to arbitrary SBMs with linear size communiti
 es. The developed algorithm is a linearized acyclic belief propagation (AB
 P) algorithm\, which mitigates the effects of cycles while provably achiev
 ing the KS threshold in $O(n \\ln n)$ time. This extends prior methods by 
 achieving universally the KS threshold while reducing or preserving the co
 mputational complexity. ABP is also connected to a power iteration method 
 on a generalized nonbacktracking operator\, formalizing the spectral-messa

 an intriguing discovery related to Random Fourier Features: replacing mult
 iplication by a random Gaussian matrix with multiplication by a properly s
 caled random orthogonal matrix significantly decreases kernel approximatio
 n error. We call this technique Orthogonal Random Features (ORF)\, and pro
 vide theoretical and empirical justification for its effectiveness. Motiva
 ted by the discovery\, we further propose Structured Orthogonal Random Fea

 es to speed up the computation. The method reduces the time cost from $\\m
 athcal{O}(d^2)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(d \\log d)$\, where $d$ is the data dimen
 sionality\, with almost no compromise in kernel approximation quality comp
 ared to ORF. Experiments on several datasets verify the effectiveness of O
 RF and SORF over the existing methods. We also provide discussions on usin

 to aid in synthesizing future frames. In experiments\, our model performs 
 well on both synthetic data\, such as 2D shapes and animated game sprites\

 AUC for large-scale data. A specific challenge in developing online AUC ma

 inimum is a global minimum\, 3) every critical point that is not a global 
 minimum is a saddle point\, and 4) the property of saddle points differs f
 or shallow networks (with three layers) and deeper networks (with more tha
 n three layers). Moreover\, we prove that the same four statements hold fo

 swer to the following question: how difficult to directly train a deep mod

  models of dynamics. The inverse model objective provides supervision to c
 onstruct informative visual features\, which the forward model can then pr
 edict and in turn regularize the feature space for the inverse model. The 
 interplay between these two objectives creates useful\, accurate models th
 at can then be used for multi-step decision making. This formulation has t

 large running-time overhead per iteration ii) the worst case convergence r

 th of the above shortcomings. In particular\, both memory and computation 
 overheads are only linear in the dimension\, and in addition\, in case the

DESCRIPTION:Oral:Generalization of ERM in Stochastic Convex Optimization: 
 The Dimension Strikes Back\nVitaly Feldman\nhttp://nips.cc/Conferences/201
 6/Schedule?showEvent=7476\n\nIn stochastic convex optimization the goal is
  to minimize a convex function $F(x) \\doteq \\E{f\\sim D}[f(x)]$ over a c
 onvex set $\\K \\subset \\R^d$ where $D$ is some unknown distribution and 
 each $f(\\cdot)$ in the support of $D$ is convex over $\\K$. The optimizat
 ion is based on i.i.d.~samples $f^1\,f^2\,\\ldots\,f^n$ from $D$. A common
  approach to such problems is empirical risk minimization (ERM) that optim
 izes $FS(x) \\doteq \\frac{1}{n}\\sum{i\\leq n} f^i(x)$. Here we consider 
 the question of how many samples are necessary for ERM to succeed and the 
 closely related question of uniform convergence of $FS$ to $F$ over $\\K$.
  We demonstrate that in the standard $\\ellp/\\ellq$ setting of Lipschitz-
 bounded functions over a $\\K$ of bounded radius\, ERM requires sample siz
 e that scales linearly with the dimension $d$. This nearly matches standar
 d upper bounds and improves on $\\Omega(\\log d)$ dependence proved for $\

 lerate Training of Deep Neural Networks\nTim Salimans \, Diederik P Kingma
 \nhttp://nips.cc/Conferences/2016/Schedule?showEvent=7471\n\nWe present we
 ight normalization: a reparameterization of the weight vectors in a neural
  network that decouples the length of those weight vectors from their dire
 ction. By reparameterizing the weights in this way we improve the conditio
 ning of the optimization problem and we speed up convergence of stochastic
  gradient descent. Our reparameterization is inspired by batch normalizati
 on but does not introduce any dependencies between the examples in a minib
 atch. This means that our method can also be applied successfully to recur
 rent models such as LSTMs and to noise-sensitive applications such as deep
  reinforcement learning or generative models\, for which batch normalizati
 on is less well suited. Although our method is much simpler\, it still pro
 vides much of the speed-up of full batch normalization. In addition\, the 
 computational overhead of our method is lower\, permitting more optimizati
 on steps to be taken in the same amount of time. We demonstrate the useful
 ness of our method on applications in supervised image recognition\, gener
 ative modelling\, and deep reinforcement learning.

 timization is a prominent method for optimizing expensive to evaluate blac

  live demo to explore interactively in 3D and in Virtual Reality (VR) our 
 new Virtu-al Human Actions Dataset (VHAD). Virtual Worlds are rapidly gain
 ing momentum as a reliable technique for visual training data generation. 
 This is particularly the case for video\, where manual labelling is extrem
 ely difficult or even impossible. This scarcity of adequate labeled traini
 ng data is widely accepted as a major bottleneck of deep learning algorith
 ms for important video under-standing tasks like action recognition.  VHAD
  is a tentative solution to this issue\, and consists in using modern game
  technology (esp. realistic rendering and physics engines) to generate lar
 ge scale\, densely labeled\, high-quality syn-thetic video data without an
 y manual intervention. In contrast to approaches using existing video game
 s to record limited data from human game sessions (e.g.\, [7])\, we build 
 upon the more power-ful approach of âvirtual world generationâ [1\,2]\
 , which can be seen as making a kind of serious game (dynamic virtual envi
 ronment) to be played only by (game) AIs in order to generate training dat
 a for other (perceptual) AI algorithms.  The objective of our demo is to i
 ntroduce attendees to the benefits of using these realistic virtual worlds
 \, and to allow them to identify new challenges and opportunities\, both i
 n terms of research and applications\, in particular for action recognitio
 n\, scene understanding\, autonomous driving\, deep learning\, domain adap

 Two semimetrics on probability distributions are proposed\, given as the s
 um of differences of expectations of analytic functions evaluated at spati
 al or frequency locations (i.e\, features). The features are chosen so as 
 to maximize the distinguishability of the distributions\, by optimizing a 
 lower bound on test power for a statistical test using these features. The
  result is a parsimonious and interpretable indication of how and where tw
 o distributions differ locally. An empirical estimate of the test power cr
 iterion converges with increasing sample size\, ensuring the quality of th
 e returned features. In real-world benchmarks on high-dimensional text and
  image data\, linear-time tests using the proposed semimetrics achieve com
 parable performance to the state-of-the-art quadratic-time maximum mean di

 this is the information bottleneck (IB) method\, where one seeks a code th
 at maximises information about  a relevance variable\, Y\, while constrain

 terns than the number of neurons in the network.  We propose a simple dual
 ity between this dense associative memory and neural networks commonly use
 d in models of deep learning. On the associative memory side of this duali
 ty\, a family of models that smoothly interpolates between two limiting ca
 ses can be constructed.  One limit is referred to as the feature-matching 
 mode of pattern recognition\, and the other one as the prototype regime. O
 n the deep learning side of the duality\, this family corresponds to neura
 l networks with one hidden layer and various activation functions\, which 
 transmit the activities of the visible neurons to the hidden layer. This f
 amily of activation functions includes logistics\, rectified linear units\
 , and rectified polynomials of higher degrees. The proposed duality makes 
 it possible to apply energy-based intuition from associative memory to ana
 lyze computational properties of neural networks with unusual activation f
 unctions - the higher rectified polynomials which until now have not been 
 used for training neural networks. The utility of the dense memories is il
 lustrated for two test cases: the logical gate XOR and the recognition of 
 handwritten digits from the MNIST data set.

 0\n\nSoon after the birth of modern computer science in the 1930s\, two fu
 ndamental questions arose: 1. How can computers learn useful programs from
  experience\, as opposed to being programmed by human programmers? 2. How 
 to program parallel multiprocessor machines\, as opposed to traditional se
 rial architectures? Both questions found natural answers in the field of R
 ecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)\, which are brain-inspired general purpose
  computers that can learn parallel-sequential programs or algorithms encod
 ed as weight matrices.Our first RNNaissance NIPS workshop dates back to 20
 03: http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/rnnaissance.html . Since then\, a lot 
 has happened. Some of the most successful applications in machine learning
  (including deep learning) are now driven by RNNs such as Long Short-Term 
 Memory\, e.g.\, speech recognition\, video recognition\, natural language 
 processing\, image captioning\, time series prediction\, etc. Through the 
 world's most valuable public companies\, billions of people have now acces
 s to this technology through their smartphones and other devices\, e.g.\, 
 in the form of Google Voice or on Apple's iOS. Reinforcement-learning and 
 evolutionary RNNs are solving complex control tasks from raw video input. 
 Many RNN-based methods learn sequential attention strategies.Here we will 
 review the latest developments in all of these fields\, and focus not only
  on RNNs\, but also on learning machines in which RNNs interact with exter
 nal memory such as neural Turing machines\, memory networks\, and related 
 memory architectures such as fast weight networks and neural stack machine
 s. In this context we will also will discuss asymptotically optimal progra
 m search methods and their practical relevance.Our target audience has hea
 rd a bit about recurrent neural networks but will happy to hear again a su
 mmary of the basics\, and then delve into the latest advanced stuff\, to s
 ee and understand what has recently become possible. We are hoping for tho
 usands of attendees.All talks (mostly by famous experts in the field who h
 ave already agreed to speak) will be followed by open discussions. We will
  also have a call for posters. Selected posters will adorn the environment
  of the lecture hall. We will also have a panel discussion on the bright f
 uture of RNNs\, and their pros and cons.

  \, Navdeep Jaitly \, Roger B Grosse\nhttp://nips.cc/Conferences/2016/Sche
 dule?showEvent=6257\n\nDeep Learning algorithms attempt to discover good r
 epresentations\, at multiple levels of abstraction. Deep Learning is a top
 ic of broad interest\, both to researchers who develop new algorithms and 
 theories\, as well as to the rapidly growing number of practitioners who a
 pply these algorithms to a wider range of applications\, from vision and s
 peech processing\, to natural language understanding\, neuroscience\, heal
 th\, etc. Major conferences in these fields often dedicate several session
 s to this topic\, attesting the widespread interest of our community in th
 is area of research.There has been very rapid and impressive progress in t
 his area in recent years\, in terms of both algorithms and applications\, 
 but many challenges remain.  This symposium aims at bringing together rese
 archers in Deep Learning and related areas to discuss the new advances\, t
 he challenges we face\, and to brainstorm about new solutions and directio
 ns.

DESCRIPTION:Symposium:Machine Learning and the Law\nAdrian Weller \, Thoma
 s D. Grant \, Conrad McDonnell \, Jatinder Singh\nhttp://nips.cc/Conferenc
 es/2016/Schedule?showEvent=6258\n\nAdvances in machine learning and artifi
 cial intelligence mean that predictions and decisions of algorithms are al
 ready in use in many important situations under legal or regulatory contro
 l\, and this is likely to increase dramatically in the near future. Exampl
 es include deciding whether to approve a bank loan\, driving an autonomous
  car\, or even predicting whether a prison inmate is likely to offend agai
 n if released. This symposium will explore the key themes of privacy\, lia
 bility\, transparency and fairness specifically as they relate to the lega
 l treatment and regulation of algorithms and data. Our primary goals are (
 i) to inform our community about important current and ongoing legislation
  (e.g. the EUâs GDPR https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeneralDataProtection
 _Regulation which introduces a "right to explanation")\; and (ii) to bring
  together the legal and technical communities to help form better policy i
 n the future.
